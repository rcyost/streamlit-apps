# streamlitPlay

## Goal: explore using streamlit to make apps in python

Seems comparable to flexboard in R though a bit more features.

Found a nice example of a realtime app and played around with it.

Didn't work with state at all so still a bit basic.

to run real time app in cli type:
streamlit run consumer_v3.py
uvicorn producer_v3:app
